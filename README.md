# ü•ñ Gebu Bakery Bread Ordering System (C Language)

A simple **console-based bread ordering system** written in C.  
It allows customers to order different types of bread (White Loaf, Wheat Loaf, Bun, and Croissant) with optional fillings.  
The program calculates subtotals, total cost, and applies a **special ice cream reward** for large self-pickup orders.
